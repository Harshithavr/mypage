		<h1> About bills in parliament </h1>
		<p >Even before a bill is introduced in the Parliament there may be a lot of debate on the need for introducing such a bill. political party  election promises or to improve its chances of winning forthcoming elections. Interest groups, media and citizensâ€™ forums may also persuade the government for a particular legislation. Law making is thus not merely a legal procedure but also a political course of action. </p>
		<p >The preparation of a bill itself involves many considerations such as resources required to implement the law, the support or opposition that the bill is likely to produce, the impact that the law may have on the electoral prospect of the ruling party etc. In the era of coalition politics especially, a bill proposed by the government has to be acceptable to all the partners of the coalition. Such practical considerations can hardly be ignored. The Cabinet considers all these before arriving at a decision to enact a law.</p>
